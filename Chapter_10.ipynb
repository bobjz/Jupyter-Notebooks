    "# Chapter 10: Credit Modeling\n",
    "&copy; 2020 Kenneth Winston\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 3 we investigated the seeming impossibility of uncertainty arising from certainty: even when we know exactly when and how much money we will get in the future, the value we assign today to that future money can be highly variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty doesn't stop there. \"Fixed-income\" (US usage) or \"fixed-interest\" (UK usage) securities are those where the parties agree in advance on the schedule of future cash flows. But the \"fixed\" cash flows may be anything but certain. For example, there may be an arrangement where the amount of money to be exchanged is contingent on an interest rate that is unknown today, like the level of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ([SOFR](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr)) at the time of the payment. Securities that make payments contingent on future benchmark interest rates are called **`floating rate`** instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also possible that the uncertainty is unwanted. A borrower and a lender may agree on specific dollar amounts to be paid by the borrower in the future, but the borrower may be unable or unwilling to pay the agreed amounts. **`Credit risk`** is the uncertainty about whether or not borrower will fail to make agreed cash flows in the agreed amounts and/or at the agreed times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll discuss credit risk arising from corporate and sovereign borrowers. Lenders typically perform credit risk assessments themselves as they assemble credit portfolios, but they may also rely on information providers called credit ratings agencies that provide scores to potential lenders. We'll discuss some of the qualitative and quantitative methods that lenders and credit ratings agencies use."

    "## 10.1 Basic credit risk concepts ##\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted in Chapter 3 that the general form of a financial instrument contemplates a series of cash flows $c_1,\\dots,c_n$ at times $0\\leq t_1,\\dots,t_n$. Perhaps the simplest example of this is a default-free zero-coupon bond where there are two cash flows: one amount $c_1<0$ from the lender to the borrower at time $t_1=0$, and another one for a predetermined amount $c_2>0$ from the borrower to the lender at a predetermined time $t_2$ in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reflect the value now of cash flows $c_i$ at times $t_i$ in the future, we contemplated discount rates $r_i$ that would reflect current market views on what those future cash flows are worth today. We saw that we could use those discount rates to \"bring back\" the future cash flows to the present:\n",
    "$$P_t=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{c_i}{(1+r_i)^{t_i}}\\label{eq:discrete_discounting}\\tag{10.1a}$$\n",
    "$$P_t=\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i exp(-r_i t_i)\\label{eq:continuous_discounting}\\tag{10.1b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two formulas represent different discounting conventions. \\eqref{eq:discrete_discounting} (which is the same as (3.2) with a slight change of notation) represents a discrete period discounting method, which is often close to what is used in practice. \\eqref{eq:continuous_discounting} represents continuous compounding which often is easier than \\eqref{eq:discrete_discounting} to manipulate in formulas. Setting $r_i(b)=ln(1+r_i(a))$, often a very slight change, makes the two equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk contemplates a stochastic **`time to default`** $t_d>0$: that is, a time, not currently known, at which the borrower becomes unable to fully pay scheduled cash flows $c_j,c_{j+1},\\dots,c_n$[$^1$](#ten_footnotes), where $j$ indexes the first $t_j\\geq t_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-default, the lender may receive nothing ($c_j=\\dots=c_n=0$), although this is rare and usually occurs only in situations where the entire economic system has broken down.\n",
    "\n",
    "More likely there is a **`recovery amount`** that is greater than zero but less than the scheduled amounts. **`Loss given default, LGD,`** is the complement of recovery: it is the difference between the amount scheduled to be received and the amount actually received. **`Severity`** is another term for LGD, although severity is often expressed in percentage terms while LGD is often expressed in monetary terms. **`Expected loss`** is the probability of default times the expected loss given default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit-risky bonds understandably command lower prices than otherwise identical default-free bonds. A common way to account for this is to introduce a **`spread`** (denoted here by \"s\") into the discounting formula.\n",
    "$$P_t^{CR}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{c_i}{(1+r_i+s)^{t_i}}\\label{eq:discrete_credit}\\tag{10.2a}$$\n",
    "$$P_t^{CR}=\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i exp(-(r_i+s) t_i)\\label{eq:continuous_credit}\\tag{10.2b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Chapter 3, the $r_i$ in the denominator are based on some default-free curve, such as the US Treasury curve, the Japanese Government Bond curve, the UK gilt curve, etc. So these $r_i$ are the same as the ones used in \\eqref{eq:discrete_discounting} and \\eqref{eq:continuous_discounting} for default-free bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the bond in question has credit risk (which we've denoted by the superscript CR on the price), then $P_t^{CR}<P_t$, where $P_t$ is the price of an identical default-free bond. The default-free discount rates $r_i$ will not be big enough; the future cash flows of the credit-risky bond need to be discounted even more to bring the price down from $P_t$ to $P_t^{CR}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional discount amount $s$ is simply a plug number: it's the amount that makes the pricing equation (\\eqref{eq:discrete_credit} or \\eqref{eq:continuous_credit} depending on the discounting convention we want to use) come out right. We know every other term: the price $P_t^{CR}$ observed in the market, the default-free discount rates $r_i$ which we obtain from observing default-free bonds; and the planned cash flows and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "How big does $s$ have to be? That depends on the market's assessment of the expected loss and the market's risk appetite. In theory, if the market thinks the bond is truly default-free, then we should see $s=0$. But in practice, spreads exist for many reasons other than compensation for the possibility of default. For example, corporate bonds are generally less liquid than major government bonds, so corporate spreads include some compensation for the perceived difficulty in buying or selling the instrument. We'll see in Figure 10.3 below that a typical spread for very high credit quality corporate bond is about $s=83$bps per year; very little of this is compensation for loss given default.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many other pricing equations, \\eqref{eq:discrete_credit} or \\eqref{eq:continuous_credit} can be used as quoting conventions, where we solve for price as a function of spread. Thus we might quote a bond from a credit-risky issuer as \"200 over,\" meaning that a spread $s$ of 200 basis points over default-free discounting will give the market price when plugged into the appropriate pricing equation \\eqref{eq:discrete_credit} or \\eqref{eq:continuous_credit}."

    "## 10.2 Credit ratings ##\n",
    "\n",
    "For centuries, lenders have tried to find out as much as possible about potential borrowers so that they (the lenders) can assess their chances of being repaid. Borrowers need to demonstrate to lenders that they (the borrowers) have a reasonable chance of repaying the money loaned to them, or they simply won't be able to borrow. Insisting that the borrower have a tenable fiscal position is the first line of defense against default for any lender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some lenders rely on personal knowledge. In the classic 1946 film [It's a Wonderful Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/plotsummary), George Bailey runs the Bailey Building and Loan company in the tiny town of Bedford Falls, where he personally knows every actual and potential borrower. While George has near-perfect information about his cohort of borrowers, he has no ability to expand and diversify his business by making loans outside his immediate community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making loans to strangers involves less information &mdash; which we know means more risk &mdash; than making loans to family, friends and neighbors. On the other hand, making loans to strangers allows lenders to diversify and expand. Information networks thus arose to supply financial data and assessments of creditworthiness of businesses and individuals to potential lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Hoffman, Postel-Vinay, and Rosenthal[$^2$](#ten_footnotes) found that starting in the seventeenth century a robust network of notaries public arranged transactions between French borrowers and lenders who didn't know each other. Hoffman et. al. highlight transactions between parties in the French province of Burgundy with parties in Lyon and Paris:\n",
    ">For transactions to take place over such distances, lenders in large and distant cities such as Lyon or Paris had to believe that collateral pledges of Burgundian lands were valuable and plausible. That required information, and if intermediaries had not provided it, then the nobles in Burgundy could only have borrowed from other Burgundians... The implication is that our intermediaries &mdash; the notaries &mdash; furnished information services over a broad geographical area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this network the borrower and the lender didn't need to know each other directly, but personal knowledge was still important: a Burgundian borrower knew a Burgundian notary who knew a Parisian notary who knew a Parisian lender. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually such personal knowledge chains were dispensed with in favor of data, as computers and communications expanded to where vast amounts of information about individuals could be collected and analyzed. In 1958, engineer Bill Fair and mathematician Earl Isaac formed the [Fair, Isaac Company](https://www.fico.com/en/about-us#history). Currently called FICO, the company provides [FICO&reg; scores](https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-scores) rating millions of potential individual borrowers looking for credit cards, mortgages, automobile loans, and the like. The consumers of these scores are generally financial institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to services providing credit information and credit scores of individuals, services exist to supply this information about companies. One of the earliest such services in the US was the Mercentile Agency. This was a forerunner of [Dun & Bradstreet](https://www.dnb.com) which continues to offer corporate credit information to this day, like [this sample](https://www.dnb.com.lv/en/D&B-Sample.html). The [history section of the company's website](https://www.dnb.com/about-us/company/history.html) says:\n",
    ">To help American merchants in their decision-making, an enterprising businessman named Lewis Tappan began, in 1841, to establish a network of correspondents that would function as a source of reliable, consistent and objective credit information. His Mercantile Agency, located in New York City, was one of the first organizations formed for the sole purpose of providing business information to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"network of correspondents\" established by the Mercantile Agency in the mid-1800s was similar to the network of notaries public that Hoffman et. al. documented in 1600-1800s France. Over time, personal reporting gave way to the corporate information databases now in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mercantile Agency (subsequently Dun & Bradstreet) ratings were applied to companies and were generally used by suppliers wanting to know their chances of getting paid. In the early 1900s, [John Moody](https://web.archive.org/web/20051103055906/http://www.moodys.com/moodys/cust/AboutMoodys/AboutMoodys.aspx?topic=history) \n",
    "adapted the application of credit rating systems to a new subject: corporate bonds. Moody eventually assigned letter grades to most corporate bonds in the US, from Aaa (meaning the highest credit quality with virtual certainty of repayment) down to D (meaning defaulted). Today [Moody's Corp.](https://www.moodys.com) is one of the largest bond rating services, rating a large portion of all bonds issued worldwide. These include the original corporate bonds as well as sovereign (government) bonds and structured credit, which we'll discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lawrence Wright](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/monetary-policy/brief-history-credit-rating-agencies-how-financial-regulation#end4) summarized the establishment of corporate bond credit rating agencies in the early twentieth century:\n",
    ">Moody's firm was followed by Poor's Publishing Company in 1916, the Standard Statistics Company in 1922, and the Fitch Publishing Company in 1924. These firms sold their bond ratings to bond investors in thick rating manuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor's and Standard Statistcs eventually merged into Standard & Poor's, which continues to provide credit ratings today as part of S&P Global Corp. The \"Big Three\" credit rating agencies today consist of [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com), [Standard & Poor's](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/about/index.aspx), and [Fitch](https://www.fitchratings.com): in 2011 they collectively comprised a market share of roughly 95% according to the German news service [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/sp-warning-puts-damper-on-eurogroup-plans/a-15212433).\n",
    "\n",
    "The provision of credit rating opinions is considered as important to the smooth functioning of the economy as the provision of accounting audits. Just as accountants need to be certified by their local or national government, so too do credit ratings agencies. In the US, the Securities & Exchange Commission maintains a list of [Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations](https://www.sec.gov/ocr/ocr-learn-nrsros.html), or \"NRSRO's.\" The list currently includes the Big Three and seven others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authority has a [registration and certification program](https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-agencies/supervision) for credit ratings agencies. The [ESMA approved list](https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-agencies/risk), like the US list, includes the Big Three and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Three have similar but not identical rating scales for long-term debt.  [Moodys' scale](https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/AboutMoodysRatingsAttachments/MoodysRatingSymbolsandDefinitions.pdf) has notches that look like Aaa, Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, ..., Caa3, Ca, and C in descending order. [Standard & Poors' scale](https://www.standardandpoors.com%/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352) is very similar, but (along with Fitch) uses all capital letters and plusses and minuses. Thus Moody's rating Aa3 is similar to Standard & Poor's rating AA-. Moody's definitions of its major notches are quite qualitative:\n",

    "------------- | -------------\n",
    "Moody's Rating Classification  | Explanation\n",
    "Aaa  | Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk\n",
    "Aa  | Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk\n",
    "A  | Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to  low credit risk\n",

    "Ba  | Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk\n",
    "B  | Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk\n",
    "Caa  | Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk\n",
    "Ca  | Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest\n",
    "C  | Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect of recovery of principal and interest\n",

In effect, regulators had endowed third-party safety judgments with the force of law.\n",

    "Over the 99 years 1920-2018, the average default rate of investment grade (\"IG\") bonds was 0.14% per year, while the average default rate of speculative grade bonds was 2.81% per year. For IG bonds the worst default rate in the 99 year period was 1.55% in 1938. Thus IG defaults, even in the Great Depression, were relatively rare. It is apparent from the chart above that the IG median and mode default rates are both zero. That’s why we had to use a different scale for IG (left) as opposed to speculative (right); the IG defaults would barely have been visible otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, the rating agencies look largely to time-invariant quantities such as leverage (the ratio of enterprise value to equity) to set the ratings. An enterprise that is largely funded through debt is probably going to have a higher chance of default on that debt than an enterprise that is largely funded through equity. That leads to the ordinal reliability that we noted above.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's clear from the historical record that the chance of default varies widely over time. 15.77% of speculative bonds defaulted in 1933; none in 1946. Thus the cardinal meaning of credit ratings needs to be understood in context. In a low-volatility market, the chance of a move in asset value down to the point of default is lower than the chance of a move to default in a high-volatility market.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Figure 10.1 shows that investment grade defaults are rare, it doesn't take into account **`ratings migration`**. An investment grade company that gets into financial trouble might see its bonds become **`fallen angels`**, i.e bonds that are downgraded to speculative grade although they haven't (yet) defaulted. Sometimes these bonds recover and become **`rising stars`**, bonds that were speculative grade but that have been upgraded to investment grade. However if instead the financial deterioration continues, the bonds may default. In this case, their last rating before default was speculative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratings migration process may take years, so it may be that a bond that is currently rated (say) AA will default ten years from now after migrating down to (say) single-B. The large credit rating agencies track historical cumulative probabilities of default by year after a bond has a particular rating.

    "For example, a very small fraction (3bps) of AAA bonds defaulted two years after being rated AAA. Since no bonds defaulted within one year of being rated AAA, there must have been down-migrations in ratings for the tiny fraction that did default after two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 10.2 also confirms that the ordinal property virtually always holds for credit ratings: as we read across the rows of the table, default frequencies go up as the notches go down in quality. There is a small exception in the very rare defaults between 3 and 6 years from AAA to AA, but otherwise the order is as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 10.2 comes from Standard & Poor's, while Figure 10.1 comes from Moody's. But the orders of magnitude of default frequencies are similar: restricting the Moody's data to the same time period (1981 on) as the Standard & Poor's data, the one-year investment grade average default rate was 8.7bps, virtually the same as the 9bps in Table 10.2. The corresponding one-year default rates for speculative grade were 4.21% (Moody's) and 3.66% (Standard & Poor's).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus while Moody's and Standard and Poor's target relative rankings in their ratings processes as shown in Table 10.1, over long periods they seem to come up with similar levels of cardinal credit ratings (i.e. levels of defaults). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are methods that directly target default levels using algorithms intended to find a firm's **`expected default frequency (EDF)`** given its financial condition and other inputs. These methods are usually based on the Merton structural model that we first saw in Chapter 8. For example, Barclays Bank developed a Corporate Default Probability Model that directly estimated default probabilities. Figure 10.2 shows the Barclays model estimated probabilities compared to Moody's historical frequencies on a log-scale:"

    "The Barclays estimates were made in 2009 at the height of the Global Financial Crisis, so they are understandably higher than the long-term Moody's frequencies. But the orders and shapes are similar. Both methods produce something that looks like a straight line on a log-scale, which means that default probabilities/frequencies increase exponentially as ratings go down. For the Barclays estimates, the ratings were not an input but rather were used to group the bonds after the estimates were made."

    "### 10.2.3 Sovereign Debt Ratings ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit ratings are also applied to sovereign (government) bonds, including national governments and local authorities like states, provinces, cities, and government agencies like the [Port Authority of New York and New Jersey](https://corpinfo.panynj.gov/pages/consolidated-bonds-notes/) or the [Eksportfinans ASA](https://www.eksportfinans.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a saying that \"corporations default because they have to; sovereigns default because they want to.\" This is an exaggeration, but sovereigns may have options that corporations don't:\n",
    "- Sovereigns can raise taxes or tolls on their subjects\n",
    "- If a sovereign controls the currency in which the debt is to be repaid, it can create more and pay back in debased currency\n",
    "- Sovereigns can choose to abrogate other obligations like payments to retired workers\n",
    "- Sovereigns can nationalize private property by law or by force &mdash; an extreme form of taxation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a corporation, default is an existential choice: after default a corporation may cease to exist altogether; at the very least it will be significantly restructured. So corporations generally default when they just can't pay their debts.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sovereigns may have a choice as to how much pain they want to inflict on their citizens using the options above. Sovereigns also don't face the existential threat from default that corporations do: the sovereign will continue to exist after default. It may find some of its assets seized in partial payment of the debt, and it may very well find that it can't borrow again for quite a while after default. But a defaulting sovereign will continue to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact even financial punishments for sovereign default &mdash; like inability to borrow further &mdash; are uncertain. Consider Argentina's debt history in Table 10.3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 10.3 | Argentina Debt History[$^4$](#ten_footnotes)\n",
    "------------- | -------------\n",
    "<u>Year  | <u>Event\n",
    "1816  | Argentina declares independence from Spain\n",
    "1827  | Defaults on debt because Bank of England hiked interest rates\n",
    "1890  | Default; contributed to Bank of England need to rescue House of Baring\n",
    "1951  | Default\n",
    "1956  | Restructuring; military coup\n",
    "1982  | Default\n",
    "1989  | Default; general emerging market debt crisis\n",
    "2001  | Default; unsustainable heavy borrowing during 1990s\n",
    "2014  | Default\n",
    "2017  | Sells 100-year bond that is 4x oversubscribed\n",
    "2019  | Begins restructuring \"massive\" debt in August\n",
    "\n",
    "After becoming a nation in 1816 and fighting a war of independence, Argentina was able to borrow from international banks largely based in London. By 1827, however, as part of a general crisis in Latin American debt, Argentina defaulted. Understandably, international lenders would not loan money to Argentina for decades after that.\n",
    "    \n",
    "But fifty years after the 1826 default, Argentina had a completely different government and a completely different economy. So it's also understandable that foreign lenders would feel that they could return. In particular, the British House of Baring was heavily involved in loans to Argentina when Argentina defaulted again in 1890. Argentina's default would have led to Baring's default but for a rescue operation by the Bank of England[$^5$](#ten_footnotes).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Again, it's understandable that Argentina was not able to borrow for quite a while after the 1890 default. But by the mid-1900s it built up debt as, once again, lenders reasoned that there was a completely different government and a completely different economy than the one that defaulted so long ago in 1890.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next default was in 1951. Using the reasoning outlined above, Argentina should have been unable to borrow for a number of decades as international lenders penalized the country and waited for a complete change in people, government and economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Table 10.3 shows a pattern of rapid-fire defaults, in some cases only a few years apart, after the 1951 default. Argentina was even able to sell a \"century bond\" &mdash; a bond not requiring repayment of principal for 100 years &mdash; three years after its 2014 default. Two years after that, Argentina restructured its debt again.\n",

    "Why would any lender trust a country with a long history of defaulting on debt, and with a fresh default in the recent past? Part of the answer to that question is in the satirical title of the paper (later a book) by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff: *This Time is Different: A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises.* Financial actors convince themselves that *this time is different* even though it isn't. Explaining in 2017 why investing in the 100-year bond issue was a good idea, a [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5ac33abc-551b-11e7-9fed-c19e2700005f) article said:\n",
    ">[The Argentines] \"cured\" the latest default in 2016, and times have changed, said Joe Harper, a partner at Explorador Capital Management, an investment fund focused on Latin America. \"The policy pendulum in Argentina has shifted to the centre, and the country’s next 100 years will be very different than the last century.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Two years into the \"very different\" century after 2017, there was a new government and a new debt restructuring in Argentina. Witty credit market participants have characterized restructuring as \"amend, extend and pretend.\" This means that when a debtor cannot pay, the lenders amend the debt agreements, extend the time allowed to repay, and pretend that these measures will somehow allow them eventually to recover their principal and interest. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Another, more hard-headed, rationale for lending to a serial defaulter is that a bond's default does not necessarily mean that investing in that bond was a bad idea. Argentina's 100-year bonds paid almost 8% a year. At the time that was about 5.1% a year higher than the US Treasury long-term rate. An investor might have no illusions about Argentina's ability to last 100 years without defaulting. But an investor might more realistically think that the next default would be at least 20 years in the future. By that time, given the high coupon on the bonds, the investor would have recovered principal and made some profit. Further, a keen-eyed investor might note that there is often some partial recovery of principal in default or restructuring. So with a high coupon and some recovery, an investor might expect to turn a nice profit even with a default.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that was just the downside scenario. There was also an upside scenario where, at least for a while, Argentina's fiscal picture improved and the 5.1% spread over US Treasurys tightened by (say) 2%, leading to a rapid double-digit percentage increase in the price of the bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the upside didn't happen, nor did the default scenario take a comfortably long time to play out. But it was not illogical in 2017 to expect that it might be longer than two years until Argentina's next default.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Despite the many options that sovereigns have that corporations don't, and despite the relatively mild punishment for sovereign default compared to corporate default, the historic default rates are quite similar. Table 10.4 is the sovereign equivalent of Table 10.2. While they aren't exactly the same, the orders of magnitude are very similar.\n",

    "When corporate bonds did default in the period 1983-2018, recovery rates given default (\"RGD\"s) averaged approximately 44% for investment grade bonds and 40% for speculative grade bonds.[$^7$](#ten_footnotes) A rough calculation of the average loss rate for investment grade bonds is therefore 0.14% (the average rate computed just after Figure 10.2) times (100%-44%), or 8bps a year. Due to the nature of averaging that rough calculation is not quite right, but for the period 1983-2018 Moody’s calculated loss rates directly and obtained a number on this order of magnitude: 5bps as the average loss rate in the year after bonds are rated investment grade.[$^8$](#ten_footnotes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 99.86% of non-defaulting bonds would therefore need to yield 5-8 bps more than US Treasurys to make up for the defaulting bonds. In fact investors receive far more than 5-8bps extra yield over Treasurys on investment grade bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 10.3 shows the extra yield (over comparable Treasurys) received by investment-grade corporate bonds: the lower line is for the highest-rated investment-grade bonds (Aaa Moody’s=AAA S&P), while the higher line shows the extra yield received for the lowest-rated investment grade corporate bonds (Baa Moody’s=BBB S&P)."

    "For the 101 years from the beginning of 1919 to the end of 2019, AAA spreads averaged 83bps per year higher that US Treasurys. We saw from Table 10.2 that the cumulative default rate for AAA's was 92bps over 15 years. Recovery rates are about 40% so the 15-year loss rate was about 46bps, or about 3bps per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "BBB spreads averaged 201bps per year over Treasurys; the 15-year default rate was 487bps, leading to roughly a $487*.4/15=13$bps/year loss rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it appears that the spreads are too big compared to the loss rates they compensate for. We know that risk-neutral prices include a component of risk preference, and it seems reasonable that bondholders would be highly risk-averse. So spreads should be bigger than loss rates. But 83bps vs. 3bps? 201bps vs. 13bps?\n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility is that we haven't really calculated the rates of return of investing in corporate bonds. AAA spreads are formed by taking the average of spreads of AAA bonds; when a bond is downgraded below AAA its spread increases and the bondholder suffers a negative return, but it is no longer included in the AAA spread calculation so that negative effect is not taken into account. Similarly if a BBB bond is either upgraded or downgraded out of the BBB category, it simply disappears from the calculation without any consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it would be more realistic to track the rates of return of groups of bonds. We do that in the next cell."

    "## 10.4 The Merton Model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "We briefly described the [Merton Model](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1540-6261.1974.tb03058.x) in Section 8.5.1. Now we'll return to that model in greater detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merton assumed that a corporate enterprise had borrowed a principal amount $D_{par}$ in the form of a single zero-coupon bond due at time $T$ from now. In order to be a [going concern](https://www.aicpa.org/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/sas_132.pdf) and not enter bankruptcy, the company's enterprise value at time $T$, $V(T)$, will need to be at least $D_{par}$. Anything left over will go to the stockholders, so at time $T$ a going concern will have $V(T)=D_{par}+S(T)$ where $S(T)\\geq0$ is the value of the company's stock (equity) at time $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merton assumed that the enterprise value $V$ follows a lognormal process like (3.22):\n",
    "$$dV=\\mu V dt+\\sigma_V V d\\beta\\label{eq:merton_lognormal}\\tag{10.4}$$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the enterprise value's mean return. An application of It&ocirc;'s lemma gives\n",
    "$$dln(V)=(\\mu-\\sigma_V^2/2)dt+\\sigma_V d\\beta$$\n",
    "Thus the logarithm of enterprise value follows a diffusion process that starts at the current point $ln(V(0))$. At time $T$ from now, log of enterprise value is normally distributed with mean $\\mathbb{E}[ln(V(T))]=ln(V(0))+\\bigl(\\mu-\\sigma_V^2/2\\bigr)T$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_V \\sqrt{T}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the time-$T$ distribution of enterprise values in which the company is in default is the part where $ln(V(T))<ln(D_{par})$. We can compute the **`distance to default`**, which is the number of standard deviations between the mean and the default threshold:\n",
    "$$d_{Def}=\\frac{\\mathbb{E}[ln(V(T))]-ln(D_{par})}{\\sigma_V\\sqrt{T}}=\\frac{ln(V(0)/D_{par})+\\bigl(\\mu-\\frac{\\sigma_V^2}{2}\\bigr)T}{\\sigma_V\\sqrt{T}}\\label{eq:merton_distance_default}\\tag{10.5}$$\n",
    "Under Merton's assumption that the diffusion process is normal, this means that the real-world (as opposed to risk-neutral) probability of default in the Merton model is $N(-d_{Def})$, where $N()$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option pricing formulas can be used to obtain the risk-neutral (market-observed) prices of stock and debt. This follows from the observation that in addition to the going-concern case, we know the behavior of the non-going-concern (bankruptcy) case at time $T$. In that case $V(T)<D_{par}$ and $S(T)=0$; the lenders only get back a recovery fraction $D_{par}/V(T)<1$ of the amount they loaned. (As we've seen above that recovery fraction averages around $40-44\\%$ of $D_{par}$.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Merton's structural model is too elegant to survive in the wild. For example, large companies have a lot of different debt issues maturing at different times and usually paying coupons. This drives a wedge between the Merton model's mathematically tractable assumption of a single zero-coupon debt issue and the multi-date credit obligations of a real company. The simple Europoean put option that contains the value of default is, in reality, more like a complicated barrier option: it will forcibly be exercised on any interim dip below the default barrier. This can radically change the value of the default option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless the structural model can be useful for assessing pure bankruptcy risk through the distance to default \\eqref{eq:merton_distance_default} calculation. While it may not be as accurate as we'd like for assessing spread movements in bonds, it may be helpful in assessing the probabilities of defaults for companies that have borrowed money from a bank. Those probabilities can in turn be used to decide how much capital the bank needs to set aside to protect against losses in its loan portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, [Stephen Kealhofer, John McQuown, and Oldrich Vasicek](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/about-us/history/kmv-history) put their initials together to form **`KMV`** in 1989. KMV computed **`expected default frequencies (EDFs)`** based on a modified version of the structural model. KMV was very successful and was acquired in 2002 by Moody's Corp, where it is now part of [Moody's Analytics](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Crosbie and Bohn (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814759595_0020) describe the KMV model. They point out a number of unrealistic assumptions by the pure Merton model.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In our study of defaults, we have found that generally firms do not default when their asset value reaches the book value of their total liabilities. While some firms certainly default at this point, many continue to trade and service their debts. The long-term nature of some of their liabilities provides these firms with some breathing room. We have found that the default point, the asset value at which the firm will default, generally lies somewhere between total liabilities and current, or short-term, liabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "KMV therefore makes the distance to default both simpler and more practical than the pure Merton version \\eqref{eq:merton_distance_default}:\n",
    "$$d_{Def}^{KMV}=\\frac{[Enterprise Value]-[Default Point]}{[Enterprise Value][Enterprise Volatility]}\\label{eq:KMV_distance_default}\\tag{10.15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The default point takes into account the issues noted above; the market value of assets is more complicated to observe than just equity+debt; and asset volatility is more complicated to observe as well. To estimate these figures, KMV-type models use an [iterative method](#iterative_enterprise_value) like the one we saw above. KMV use historical information as well as current information to make their estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KMV method starts by making a guess as to the current enterprise value of the company in question, which we'll call $V_0^0$. The market value of the company's stock at the present time, which we'll call $S_0$, can be observed if it's publicly listed. If not, a factor model as in Chapter 5 can be used so that company characteristics like book-to-price, market capitalization, and industry can be projected into an estimated market value. The equity (stock) vlatility $\\sigma_S$ can also be observed either from implied volatilities of the company's options, or from historical log-prices, or from historical factors projected into log-prices. An initial guess as to enterprise volatility $\\sigma_{V,0}$ can be made with a simple proportional estimate $\\sigma_{V,0}=\\frac{\\sigma_S S_0}{V_0^0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far the method is the same as the simple Merton model; we've just extended the notation a little. But here KMV begins to diverge. Instead of a European option valuation formula, KMV use a custom option pricing formula developed by Vasicek and Kealhofer (the \"VK\" formula). The VK formula prices a perpetual option where the strike price (the default point) is an absorbing barrier &mdash; whenever the enterprise value hits the default point, the firm is forced to default. The firm can't wait until some future expiration date to recover. The default point takes into account points at which similar firms have defaulted in the past and looks at multiple classes of the firm's liabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "KMV then uses the VK option formula to compute an implied time series of past enterprise values $V_0^t$, $t=0,\\dots,T$ where a higher $t$ means further in the past; $t=0$ is the present.\n",

The variable left to be computed at each time period is the implied enterprise value $V_0^t$.\n",

In my view, the credit spread premium puzzle remains unsolved."

    "While most decades have a clearly negative correlation, the 1930s show that unusual economic stress, together with fiscal and monetary response, can cause a regime shift. There was a slightly positive correlation between rates and spreads in the 1930s: as in Argentina and other credit-risky countries, the survival of the country's overall economy became the single paramount factor linking rates and spreads. In other words, there was doubt that the default-free rate really was default-free."

    "In Chapter 3 we found that Macaulay duration and modified duration were eminently reasonable first-order measures of bond return sensitivity to changes in interest rates. For default-free instruments with simple cash flows, these definitions of duration suffice. But as the instruments get more complex, the cash flows $c_i$ (and possibly their times $t_i$) contemplated in the generic pricing equation (3.2) also become more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature in a corporate bond, for example, is a **`call schedule`**: the borrower can pay off the principal early if it wants to retire the debt. Usually this will only happen if prevailing rates have dropped, leaving the lender with an unwanted return of principal in a low-interest environment. We noted earlier that this can lead to lower, or even negative, convexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course credit risk can cause the cash flows to drop due to the borrower’s inability to repay. If a credit-risky bond defaults before maturity, repayment of any recovery amount will be accelerated, decreasing duration. Or the cash flows can be based on a formula that floats with the current rate of interest. Thus there can be a breakdown in the equivalence between (1) Macaulay's original concept of duration as the average time at which cash flows are received; and (2) a multiple of the first derivative of the price with regard to a parallel shift in the discount curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (3.7) – in which we explicitly showed the relationship between cash flows and first and second derivatives – can become difficult to evaluate if the cash flows are contingent on future events. Here $y=1/(1+r)$, $r$ the discount rate:\n",

    "Instruments may even be path-dependent. For example, **`knockout options`** automatically exercise themselves as soon as the underlying asset goes above or below certain prices. If we knew that a bond was at $100$ at inception of a knockout option and was again at $100$ at maturity of the knockout option, we wouldn't have enough information to know how the option would have behaved. If the knockout strike was at $90$, then if the bond's price looked like $100(1+sin(\\pi t)/2)$ as $t$ went from $0$ at inception to $1$ at maturity, the knockout would not have been triggered. But with a price path looking like $100(1-sin(\\pi t)/2)$, the option would have exercised.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take into account these complexities, we assume there is a pricing function $P(r,s)$ that takes a number of arguments, only two of which we list explicitly: $r$, the vector (or continuous function) of default-free discount rates; and $s$, the scalar spread that we need to add to the default-free discount rates to make the price of the bond equal the market observed price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \\eqref{eq:discrete_credit} and \\eqref{eq:continuous_credit} we showed a simple version of the pricing formula as a function of a credit spread. However when there are complex features to the bond, we may need to use a Monte Carlo simulation run over many possible paths of interest rates or credit events to see what the price should be. The spread $s$ that makes the more complex pricing function equal the market price is called the **`option-adjusted spread (OAS)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Effective duration`** is a generalization of the durations we've previously seen. To compute effective duration, the $r$ vector in the complex pricing function $P(r,s)$ is perturbed by a small scalar amount $\\Delta r$, so $r$ becomes $r\\pm u\\Delta r$, where $u$ is the vector of all ones. This gives a finite difference approximation to the (negative of) the derivative of the price with respect to a parallel shift in the discount curve:\n",
    "$$D_E(r,s,\\Delta r)=\\frac{P(r-u\\Delta r,s)-P(r+u\\Delta r,s)}{2\\Delta r P(r,s)}\\label{eq:effective_duration}\\tag{10.20}$$\n",
    "Similarly we can define **`effective convexity`** as a finite difference approximation to the second derivative divided by price:\n",
    "$$C_E(r,s,\\Delta r)=\\frac{P(r-u\\Delta r,s)-2P(r,s)+P(r+u\\Delta r,s)}{(\\Delta r)^2P(r,s)}$$\n",
    "$$\\approx\\frac{D_E(r-u(\\Delta r/2),s,\\Delta r/2)-D_E(r+u(\\Delta r/2),s,\\Delta r/2)}\n",
    "{\\Delta r P(r,s)}\\label{eq:effective_convexity}\\tag{10.21}$$\n",
    "The second line of \\eqref{effective_convexity} is an approximation, not an equality, because the denominators of the $D_E$'s are not quite the same as the denominator in the definitional first line. The difference is a higher-order effect so it's usually not noticeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective duration $D_E$ will approximate a suitably scaled version of our previous definitions of duration when the cash flows are simple enough, but in the presence of optionality, floating rates, and possible default, $D_E$ may differ. Similarly for effective convexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define **`option-adjusted spread duration (OASD)`**. Not surprisingly, this is:\n",
    "$$OASD(r,s,\\Delta s)=\\frac{P(r,s-u\\Delta s)-P(r,s+u\\Delta s)}{2\\Delta s P(r,s)}\\label{eq:OASD_definition}\\tag{10.22}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition \\eqref{eq:effective_duration} of effective duration contemplates adding (and subtracting) a scalar pertubation $\\Delta r$ to every point on the discount curve. The definition \\eqref{eq:OASD_duration} of spread duration contemplates adding (or subtracting) a scalar pertubation $\\Delta s$ to the scalar $s$ that is already being added to the discount curve. In both cases, the discount factor is changed from $r_i$ to $r_i+\\Delta something$. So shouldn't spread duration be the same as effective duration?\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the two are equal. However when optionality or the coupon in a bond depends on rates but not on spread, then effective duration (sometimes called rate duration) and spread duration can differ. For example, when the discount curve is flat a default-free floating-rate security maturing in 30 years will have effective duration close to zero, but very long spread duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk in credit portfolios is often assessed by spread duration exposure. A manager might say \"I'm 2 years long telecoms spread duration.\" As we noted with overall duration, spread duration only makes sense as a measure when it is applied to similar things. For example a year's spread duration of the African mobile telecom operator [MTN Limited](https://www.mtn.com/) is not really comparable to a year's spread duration of [China Mobile Limited](https://www.chinamobileltd.com/en/global/home.php)."

    "\n",
    "Fixed income portfolios often use factor models like the ones we saw in Chapter 5:\n",
    "$$C=BFB^{\\prime}+D\\tag{5.40, again}$$\n",
    "Recall that $B$ is an $n\\times k$ factor loading matrix giving the exposures of the $n>>k$ securities in the universe to the comparatively small number of systematic factors explaining the market's behavior. $D$ is a (sometimes omitted) diagonal matrix of systematic risks uncorrelated with anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fixed income factor risk models, the $k$ factors usually consist mainly of the following:\n",
    "1. Key rate durations on a number of default-free curves, or more precisely the moves of rates at certain points of the curve; and\n",
    "2. Spread movements for key sectors like UK investment-grade financials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passage-of-time effects like carry and rolldown (Section 3.5.5) also influence rates of return, but since they are known in advance they are not risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given security $x$, its first-order Taylor series approximation may look like\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta P_x}{P_x}=\\theta\\Delta t-\\sum_i\\bigl(KRD_{x,i}\\Delta r_i\\bigr)-SD_x \\Delta s_x\\label{credit_taylor}\\tag{10.25}$$\n",
    "Here $KRD_{x,i}$ is the security's key rate duration to the $i^{th}$ point on the security's discount curve &mdash; for example the US Treasury curve for US corporate bonds or the Japanese government curve for Japanese corporate bonds. $\\Delta r_i$ is the movement of the yield curve at that point. $SD_x$ is the bond's spread duration (usually zero if this is a default-free government bond. although there can be small spreads on government bonds since yield curves are not perfect). $\\Delta s_x$ is the move in the bond’s own spread. $\\theta$ is the sensitivity to the passage of time, including carry (which captures regular payments like coupons) and rolldown (Section 3.5.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelers want to capture systematic risk, $\\Delta s_x$ might be replaced by $\\Delta s_j$, where $j$ is a group that the instrument belongs to and that (it is hoped) has homogeneous within-group spread movements. For example, the sector might be UK investment grade financials. The risk factors going into the factor covariance matrix $F$ in (5.40) would then be: (1) changes in rates $\\Delta r_i$; and (2) changes in group spreads $\\Delta s_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, substituting a cohort spread change $\\Delta s_j$ for a security spread change $\\Delta s_x$ might not be realistic: the cohort spread level $s_j$ might be significantly different than the security spread level $s_x$, so changes, while perhaps highly correlated, might be of different sizes. One popular substitution is called **`Duration Times Spread (DTS)`** and is based on the tautological identity\n",
    "$$SD_x \\Delta s_x=\\bigl(SD_xs_x\\bigr)\\frac{\\Delta s_x}{s_x}\\label{eq:DTS_x}\\tag{10.26}$$\n",
    "The $SD_x s_x$ term multiplies $x$'s duration times its spread, hence the name DTS. DTS is considered the exposure metric, and $\\frac{\\Delta s_x}{s_x}$, which is a percentage change in $x$'s spread, is the variable to which $x$ is exposed. $\\frac{\\Delta s_x}{s_x}$ is likely to be more statistically well-behaved than $\\Delta s_x$ and thus is likely to be more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a factor model, individual variables like $\\frac{\\Delta s_x}{s_x}$ are modeled by systematic factors. It is not unreasonable to assume that $x$'s spread percentage changes would be similar to spread percentage changes in its cohort $j$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta s_x}{s_x}\\approx\\frac{\\Delta s_j}{s_j}\\label{eq:DTS_approx}\\tag{10.27}$$\n",
    "This is likely to be a much better substitution than $\\Delta s_j$ for $\\Delta s_x$. Thus in the DTS model the contribution to $x$'s security return coming from $x$'s spread changes is assumed to be\n",

    "DTS ($SD_xs_x$) is the exposure metric and $\\frac{\\Delta s_j}{s_j}$ is the risk factor to which the asset's returns are exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DTS approach has the drawback that the exposure metric can change rapidly. Spread duration $SD_x$ changes as discount curves and spreads change, but typically changes slowly over time. But spread $s_x$ can change quite rapidly. This makes a portfolio manager's task difficult: the manager might decide today on a certain exposure to a risk factor $\\frac{\\Delta s_j}{s_j}$, but tomorrow changing market conditions can radically change the exposure. This might give the manager the choice of staying with an exposure that was not desired, or of excessive trading just to maintain the desired exposure. In a nutshell: DTS is a moving target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach that has less of a moving-target problem is **`adjusted spread duration`**. It starts with a tautology like \\eqref{eq:DTS_x}:\n",

This risk factor is likely to be more badly behaved (leptokurtic, for example) than percentage changes $\\frac{\\Delta s_j}{s_j}$, but the bad behavior can be addressed with GARCH-type models. de-GARCHed spread changes are at least as good risk model citizens as are percentage spread changes."

    "## 10.7 Z-Scores, Reduced-Form, and Hybrid Models ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the disproportionate importance of default, many methods have been used to try to predict defaults. The most obvious is the use of credit ratings. While criteria like debt-to-equity ratios are used by credit rating company analysts, there isn’t an exact formula associated ratings with criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at tables like Table 10.2 and Table 10.4 to see what historical default frequencies have been for cohorts of issuers and ratings, but we know these averages belie considerable variability over different economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Edward Altman](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/edward-altman) originated a method to tie default probabilities to observable accounting criteria. In a [1968 article in the Journal of Finance](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1968.tb00843.x), he analyzed a sample of sixty-six US corporations. Thirty-three of them had filed for bankruptcy in the period 1946-1965. Thirty-three other firms were found that had similar characteristics but that had not filed for bankruptcy. It was, in 1968, onerous to compile this much data, but Altman did so and applied multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) to see what differentiated the two cohorts. MDA is a statistical technique apparently invented in the 1930's by the ubiquitous R. A. Fisher[$^{11}$](#ten_footnotes); it's similar in spirit to what are now called support vector machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Altman called the result a **`Z-score`**. His original Z-score formula was:\n",
    "$$Z=.012X_1+.014X_2+.033X_3+.006X_4+.999X_5\\label{eq:altman_z}\\tag{10.40}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $X_1$=(Working Capital)/(Total Assets);\n",
    "- $X_2$=(Retained Earnings)/(Total Assets);\n",
    "- $X_3$=EBIT/(Total Assets);\n",
    "- $X_4$=(Market Value of Equity)/(Book Value of Debt);\n",
    "- $X_5$=Sales/(Total Assets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Assets is what we called $V$ above. Working capital is the difference betweeen current assets and current liabilities, Retained earnings is the cumulative net income of the company not paid out in dividends; Altman notes that this measure discriminates against younger firms but that is realisitic since younger firms default more. EBIT is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes; more modern accounting treatments would use EBITDA which also excludes Depreciation and Amortization. Altman's $X_4$ is a ratio of quantitites we've already seen: $S/D_{par}$ using our notation above. The last ratio, involving annual sales per total assets, is one that Altman notes has little discriminatory power on its own, but that improves the model significantly in the context of the other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score in \\eqref{eq:altman_z} was calibrated so that a value over 3 meant that the company was relatively safe from bankruptcy; all of the $X_i$ are desirable features of a strong company so the higher the score, the better. A Z-score of under 2 meant that the company was bankrupt or near-bankrupt; and between 2 and 3 was ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Altman and others have updated, recalibrated, and expanded his Z-score many times since its original publication. The method is clearly sensible from a corporate fundamentals point of view, although the exact calibration can vary over time and over cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of the method is the publication of accounting data: publicly traded US companies publish accounting data in \"K's and Q's\" &mdash; [Form 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-form10khtm.html) and [Form 10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersform10qhtm.html) &mdash; on an annual and a quarterly basis, respectively. Both are [available online](http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html), but with a lag. So Z-scores will not be able to keep up with fast-changing events, especially when a company is in trouble. Non-publicly-traded companies and companies in other jurisdictions might publish accounting data on an even less frequent basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, fitting the coefficients to past data might lead to good in-sample fit, but it isn’t necessarily predictive. As is always true in the financial markets, participants adapt. if a corporate treasurer notices that lenders are going to be reluctant when $.012$ times the  working capital to total assets ratio gets too low, then they'll try to improve that ratio artificially if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, this is a powerful method and the attempt to predict defaults based on accounting measures remains a rich field today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Altman's Z-score is an example of a **`reduced-form model`**, which uses market variables and company information to predict default using regression or other statistical techniques. Altman's Z-score used only company-specific information. Other information that could be used would be general financial distress indicators such as the level of the VIX; time skew in option-implied volatilities; or even macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, some market participants use hybrid models which combine the Merton-model distance to default \\eqref{eq:merton_distance_default}, company-specific variables like Altman’s \\eqref{altman_z}, risk-neutral probabilities of default $q_d$ derived from market prices (see next section), and market variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be combined into an overall variable that estimates a probability of default $p_{hybrid}$:\n",
    "$$Z_{hybrid}=a_0+a_1d_{Def}+a_2q_d+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i+2} MarketMacroFactor_i+\\sum_{j=1}^{cf} a_{j+m+2} CompanyFactor_i\\tag{10.42}$$\n",
    "$$p_{hybrid}=\\frac{1}{1+exp(-Z_{hybrid}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients are calibrated so that companies with low probabilities of default have a large negative $Z_{hybrid}$. A term structure can be applied so that probabilities of default are predicted for a number of years forward. For example, a company with a large amount of debt coming due 5 years from now might have a spike in probability of default at that time."

    "\n",
    "Financial markets produce myriad implied variables: implied discount rates (internal rates of return); implied volatilities; implied probability densities (Breeden-Litzenberger). In credit markets, it would be helpful to try to recover implied default rates from probabilities. We know that risk-neutral default rates will probably be high compared to real-world default rates because of risk preference. But it's still informative to try to recover them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, suppose there is a zero-coupon credit-risky bond that matures in $T$ years, and suppose that it either defaults at maturity or it doesn't. In practice there could be interim default caused by other events in the issuer's corporate structure, but we'll ignore that possibility for now.\n",

    "This situation is amenable to a binomial tree approach. If the bond defaults, which it will do with a risk-neutral probability we'll call $q_d$, the lender will get a recovery amount $R$. If it doesn't default (probability $1-q_d$), the lender will get full repayment of $100$ principal. If the current market-observed price is $P$, and the observable $T$-year default-free discount rate is $r_T$, then we must have:\n",

    "\n",
    "For illustration, suppose $T$ is five years and the default-free 5-year discount rate from the zero curve is $r_T=.04$. Then the price of a default-free zero is $82.19$. If the price of a credit-risky 5-year zero is $80$, then from \\eqref{eq:qd_binom_1pd} we see that $q_d=.053$, i.e. there is a $5.3\\%$ risk-neutral probability of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can break the tree into finer and finer periods. For a coupon-paying bond, we could have a node of a binomial tree at each coupon payment. Since coupon payments are generally every 3 or 6 months, the approximation that there is default only at the nodes of the tree is more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of the tree at time 0 branches to default or to no default at time 1. If the bond defaults (with probability $q_d$), there will be a cash flow of $R$=recovery value. This is a leaf of the tree: there are no further developments after default.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the bond doesn't default (with probability $1-q_d$), there will be a coupon cash flow of amount $c$ at time 1, and the tree will continue to time 2. Once again, there are two possibilities: a default leaf with cumulative probability $q_d(1-q_d)$ and a continuation path with cumulative probability $(1-q_d)^2$. At time 2, recovery $R$ is received in case of default, while another coupon cash flow of $c$ is received in case of no default.\n",

    "As we did with \\eqref{eq:qd_binom_1pd}, if we have an observed price $P$ then we can turn around the pricing equation \\eqref{eq:qd_binom_Tpd} and solve for the risk-neutral periodic default probability $q_d$.

    "\n",
    "**`Credit Default Swaps (CDS)`** were invented by Blythe Masters at JP Morgan in London in 1994.[$^{12}$](#ten_footnotes). The market for these instruments, especially those referencing indexes rather than single securities, has become large and vibrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDS are simply insurance policies on bonds or groups of bonds. A **`protection buyer`** pays a fixed amount each year to a **`protection seller`**; the item being insured is called the **`reference entity`**. The protection seller is also called the **`CDS writer`**. The reference entity can be a corporate bond, a government bond, or (probably the most common) an index of bonds such as [SOV-X](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit-itraxx-sovx.html) (a group of government bonds); [NA.IG or SNAC (Standard North American Contract)](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit-cdx.html) (US investment grade corporate bonds); [CMBX](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit-cmbx.html) (commercial mortgage-backed securities); [ABX](https://ihsmarkit.com/products/markit-abx.html) (subprime mortgage-backed bonds); and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference entity has a **`credit event`**, a carefully legally defined concept that is more or less equivalent to default, then the seller of protection has to make sure the buyer of protection receives par. So if recovery $R=40$, the protection seller is responsible for making up the missing $60$ to the protection buyer. Most CDS are **`cash settled`**, so the protection seller just gives the monetary amount to the buyer. A few CDS are **`physically settled`**, meaning the protection buyer gives the defaulted reference entity to the protection seller, who gives the protection buyer $100$. Then the protection seller tries to recover as much as possible from the reference entity it now owns. \n",
    "\n",
    "CDS terminology is a little misleading: a protection seller hopes that the reference entity does well, and so is doing something more like buying the reference entity than selling it. Similarly the protection buyer has a negative view of the reference entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, CDS were simply bilateral contracts between the protection buyer and the protection seller. This led to an additional risk, called **`counterparty risk`**: if the protection seller defaulted at the same time as the reference entity, then the protection buyer's \"insurance policy\" was worthless. This happened during the GFC with the insurance company AIG. [McDonald & Paulson 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jep.29.2.81) explained that\n",
    ">AIG had written credit default swaps on over \\\\$500 billion in assets. But it was the \\\\$78 billion in credit default swaps on multi-sector collateralized debt obligations&mdash;a security backed by debt payments from residential and commercial mortgages, home equity loans, and more&mdash;that proved most troublesome. AIG’s problems were exacerbated by the fact that these were one-way bets. AIG didn’t have any offsetting positions that would make money if its swaps in this sector lost money.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIG faced bankruptcy as much of the collateral (reference entities) for which it had provided protection began to default. The protection buyers were virtually all other large multinational financial institutions, so AIG's failure could have started a cascade of failures across the global financial system. The US Government stepped in an bailed out AIG at a cost of \\\\$182 billion. According to the [US Department of the Treasury's Office of Financial Stability](https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/Citizens_Report_FY2013-1-28-14.pdf), by 2013 the US government had entirely exited what it gingerly called the \"AIG Investment Program\" and had not only been fully paid back, but had also made a \\\\$22.7 billion profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010, the [Dodd-Frank Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4173/text) required that index-based CDS be **`centrally cleared`**. This means that CDS contracts trade through financially secure clearinghouses in a way that makes it less likely that the default of a counterparty like AIG would be so catastrophic. The [majority of CDS trading is now centrally cleared](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1806b.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice in the US there are only two standard payment spreads: $100$bps (for investment grade reference entities) and $500$bps (for speculative grade reference entities). There is an upfront payment at the outset of a CDS that trues up the expected cash flows to the variable CDS spread $s$ that the parties expect. In Europe there are [different standard spreads](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Secondary-markets/The-European-Corporate-Single-Name-Credit-Default-Swap-Market-SMPC-Report-150218.pd).\n",
    "\n",
    "A portfolio consisting of a bond together with bought credit protection on that bond is (absent counterparty risk) roughly equivalent to a default-free bond, although cash flow timing may be different. So (roughly) $B+C=T$, where $B$=bond; $C$=CDS, $T$=US Treasury or similar default-free instrument. So (roughly) $C=T-B$: buying protection is similar to going long a default-free bond and shorting a credit-risky bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of reasoning is directionally correct, but it leaves out a number of structural features of credit default swaps. It also omits the fact that markets are not always efficient: during the GFC, capital was scarce so the prices of bonds were depressed, causing their option-adjusted spreads (OASs) to be very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "But entering into a credit default swap took little capital. So swap spreads were not as large as cash bond OASs. An entity that had the capital could buy a cash bond with a very large OAS and simultaneously buy credit protection. The CDS spread, while large, was not as large as the underlying bond OAS. This dual position would have been very profitable during the GFC, but fear of counterparty risk and lack of capital limited its use.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDS prices are quoted in spread terms. For example, a CDS spread of $60$bps means that the protection buyer pays the protection seller at an annual rate of $.006$ times the notional (par) amount of the reference entity covered by the CDS. Thus a protection buyer of CDS covering \\\\$1,000,000 par value of bonds would pay the protection seller \\\\$6,000 a year if the swap spread was $s=60$bps. In practice the payments might be periodic on a monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, real-world CDS have a number of features intended to alleviate counterparty risk in addition to central clearing. These features make it hard to specify the way CDS work in closed-form formulas; in fact the definitive way of pricing CDS spreads is through an [algorithm](https://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll give a stylized version of CDS that omits some features but that conveys some of the basic ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a **`hazard rate model`**: if $t_d$ is the random variable giving the time to a credit entity's default, then a simple hazard rate model says that its cumulative distribution function looks like\n",
    "$$Pr(t_d\\leq t)=1-exp(-\\lambda t)$$\n",
    "$\\lambda$ is the hazard rate; as it goes up, the entity is more likely to default sooner rather than later. For example if $\\lambda=1\\%$, then the half-life is about 69 years (i.e. $Pr(t_d\\leq 69)\\approx\\frac{1}{2}$). A little more generally, a positive exponent $\\alpha$ can be included on the time so that the probability looks like\n",
    "$$Pr(t_d\\leq t)=1-exp(-\\lambda t^{\\alpha})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the simple hazard rate model, we can form a probability-weighted sum of the payments that the protection buyer is expected to make over the life of a CDS:\n",
    "$$B(s,\\lambda)=s\\sum_{i=1}^N exp(-ri)exp(-\\lambda i)=exp(-(r+\\lambda))\\frac{1-exp(-(r+\\lambda)N)}{1-exp(-(r+\\lambda))}\\label{eq:cds_buyer}\\tag{10.50}$$\n",
    "Here\n",
    "- s is the swap spread, i.e. the fraction of notional paid per year by the protection buyer;\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the reference entity's hazard rate;\n",
    "- $N$ is the number of annual payments to be made over the life of the CDS, assuming no default; and\n",
    "- $r$ is the discount rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assumed continuous discounting, a flat discount curve, and protection payments made on an annual basis. The summands in the calculation \\eqref{cds_buyer} multiply the discount factor at year $i$ times the risk-neutral probability of surviving to year $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $R$ is the expected recovery amount given default, then the seller of protection is expected to pay (and the buyer is expected to receive):\n",
    "$$S(s,\\lambda)=(1-R)(1-exp(-\\lambda))\\sum_{i=1}^N exp(-ri)exp(-\\lambda(i-1))$$\n",
    "$$=(1-R)(e^{\\lambda}-1)exp(-(r+\\lambda))\\frac{1-exp(-(r+\\lambda)N)}{1-exp(-(r+\\lambda))}\\label{eq:cds_seller}\\tag{10.51}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is conventional in financial markets to price swaps so that, at inception, the buyer's expected payments equal the seller's expected payments. As time goes on, of course, one or the other gains an advantage. But at inception we have $B(s,\\lambda)=S(s,\\lambda)$, which gives a CDS swap spread of\n",
    "$$s=(1-R)(e^\\lambda-1)\\label{eq:cds_spread}\\tag{10.52}$$\n",
    "Solving for $\\lambda$ gives\n",
    "$$\\lambda=ln\\bigl(1+\\frac{s}{1-R}\\bigr)\\label{eq:cds_lambda}\\tag{10.53}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example with recovery $R=50\\%$ and a $200$bps CDS spread, the risk-neutral hazard rate is $\\lambda=ln(1.04)=3.92\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually the risk-neutral hazard rate $\\lambda$ recovered in \\eqref{eq:cds_lambda} from CDS prices is similar to the risk-neutral probability of default $q_d$ recovered from bond prices in \\eqref{eq:qd_binom_Tpd}. They aren't exactly comparably since a hazard rate gives a time-varying probability of default while $q_d$ is constant. We also used different discounting conventions. But in the limit as time periods get shorter and shorter these differences will become less important, so comparing the two figures can be informative.\n"
